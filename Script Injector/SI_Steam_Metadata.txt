Description:
[h1] Script Injector [/h1]
This is a map to help with redundant stuff. This map will help you:
[list] 
 [*] If you need to write the same line of Lua-Code into multiple scripts
 [*] If you want to create the same variable in multiple scripts with different values
 [*] if you want to add the same tags to a lot of objects
[/list]

[h2] Example use case [/h2]
We use this map to write variables into the script of 100+ cards. The cards represent monsters in our map for the game [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2526757138]Isaac: Four Souls[/url]. Each variable represent a stat of the monster.
So we sorted the monster cards by there stat value, built decks and injected in each card of each deck the stat variable with the proper value for the deck of cards.

[h2] Disclaimer [/h2]
If you use this map with decks or bags, which contain many cards or objects, it is possible that your game lags/freezes for a couple of seconds depending on your PC.
It shouldn't be longer than 30-60sec (worst case). But it will be a lot faster than writing every lua-code-line by hand.

[h2] How to use it? [/h2]
[olist]
 [*] Load your own mod map and create the objects you want to [i]inject[/i]. (This is important for the generation of the guids of the objects)
 [*] Put all the objects you want to [i]inject[/i] into an container (deck or bag).
 [*] Save the containers you created as game objects. (So you can load them later in other maps over the menu: Objects->Saved Objects)
 [*] Load the Script Injector map.
 [*] Follow the instructions on the table.
